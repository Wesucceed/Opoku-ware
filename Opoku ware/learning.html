<p>
    Opoku Ware School has been expert in educating boys for over 10 years,
     which means we can draw on a wealth of experience in how boys learn best.</p>
<p>The curriculum of Opoku Ware School follows a structure which consolidates
     study over time and provides ample opportunity for cross-curricular learning.
      Students have access to a wide selection of science and math topics and are
       supported through their choice of GCSE and A level subjects aligning with
        their strengths and passions.</p>
<p>
    We believe that thinking should be “out of the box”, not “tick the box”. Our
     teachers encourage their students to become inspired learners with inquisitive,
      original mindsets. As experts in their fields, they share their infectious passion
       for their subjects to ensure every student is stretched and challenged, but also
        able to play to his strengths.</p>
<h3>Year 1 Curriculum</h3>
<p>
    In Years 1 and 2, Science lessons cover the three main branches of Science (Biology,
     Chemistry and Physics). You will have one teacher for all Sciences, to allow you a
      broader insight of the history and philosophy of Science. We aim to include as many
       experiments and competitions as possible to make you feel more comfortable using scientific
        equipment, as well as to make you familiar with the scientific method.</p>

<h3>Biology</h3>
<p>In Biology, you will study the structure and functions of cells, the building blocks
     of life. You will also learn about how organisms reproduce, with an introduction to genetics. </p>
<h3>Chemistry</h3>
<p>In Chemistry, you will use the particle theory of matter to explain how materials can
     change. You will also learn about the chemical elements and how they form compounds,
      and you will study the properties of acids and alkalis.</p>
<h3>Physics</h3>
<p>In Physics, you will learn how forces can affect the motion of objects. You will also
     investigate how light travels from one place to another and why we see colour. You will
      find out more about the Earth’s place in the Solar System and the Universe beyond.</p>
<h3>Math</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Pythagoras’ Theorem</li>
    <li>Trigonometry</li>
    <li>Scale drawing and bearings</li>
    <li>Circles</li>
    <li>Area and Volume</li>
</ol>
<h3>Year 2 Curriculum</h3>
<p>In Year 2, the three Sciences (Biology, Chemistry and Physics) are taught together by one
     teacher. Pupils build on their knowledge from Year 7, and establish a firm foundation for
      their international GCSE studies</p>
<h3>Biology</h3>
<p>In Biology you will study the processes that maintain ecosystems and the ways in which organisms
     are adapted to their habitat. You will also learn about the inheritance of characteristics with
      an introduction to genetics.</p>
<h3>Chemistry</h3>
<p>In Chemistry you will investigate mixtures and different techniques to separate them. You will
     learn more about the Groups of the Periodic Table and the reactivity of different elements.</p>
<h3>Physics</h3>
<p>In Physics you will learn about the nature of electrical charge and investigate current and
     voltage in circuits. You will also learn about the effect of pressure, and how to describe
     the motion of objects. All of these topics are supported by a number of experiments. As the
      year progresses, you will develop your practicalskills and learn how to plan an investigation.</p>
<h3>Math</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Polygons Correlation</li>
    <li>Algebra including Solving Equations and Rearranging Formulae Inequalities</li>
    <li>Transformations</li>
    <li>Straight Line Graphs</li>
</ol>
<h3>Year 3 Curriculum</h3>
<p>Year 3 will be just about the revision and practise of all the topics taught in  Year 1 and 2.</p>
<h2>Science and Math Resources</h2>
